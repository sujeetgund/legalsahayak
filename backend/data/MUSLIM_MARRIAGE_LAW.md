# Muslim Marriage Law in India

## Chapter I: Preliminary

### Governing Law
Muslim marriage and divorce in India are not governed by a single codified act (unlike the Hindu Marriage Act). Instead, they are governed by a combination of:
1.  **Statutes:** * *The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937* (Makes Shariat the rule of decision).
    * *The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939* (Grounds for women to seek divorce).
    * *The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986* (Maintenance after divorce).
    * *The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019* (Criminalizing Triple Talaq).
2.  **Uncodified Personal Law:** Derived from the Quran, Hadith (Prophetic traditions), Ijma (Consensus), and Qiyas (Analogy).

### Section 2, Shariat Act, 1937
This section is the gateway. It states that in matters of marriage, dissolution of marriage, maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts, and inheritance, the rule of decision shall be the **Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)** where the parties are Muslims.

> **Case Law:** *C.S.S. v. Madras (1954):* Custom or usage to the contrary is abolished; Shariat is the supreme law for Muslims in personal matters.

## Chapter II: Nature and Essentials of Nikah

### Nature of Marriage
Nikah (Marriage) in Islam is a **civil contract** (*aqd*) for the legalization of sexual intercourse and the procreation of children. It is not a sacrament (sanskar) in the Hindu sense, though it has religious sanctity.

### Essentials of a Valid Nikah (Sahih)

1.  **Capacity of Parties:**
    * **Sound Mind:** Lunatics can be married by guardians (Wali) in specific circumstances.
    * **Puberty (Bulugh):** Presumed at age 15 in the absence of evidence. A minor can be married by a guardian but has the *Option of Puberty* (Khiyar-ul-Bulugh) to repudiate it later.
2.  **Offer and Acceptance (Ijab-o-Qubool):**
    * One party makes the offer (*Ijab*) and the other accepts (*Qubool*).
    * Must happen in the **same meeting** and in one session.
3.  **Free Consent:** Consent obtained by force, fraud, or coercion is void.
4.  **Witnesses:**
    * **Sunni Law:** Two male witnesses OR one male and two female witnesses are required. They must be sane, adult Muslims.
    * **Shia Law:** Witnesses are not required at the time of marriage contract but are required for divorce.
5.  **Dower (Mehr):** Though not essential for *validity* (marriage is valid even if Mehr is not specified), it is an essential *consequence* of the contract.

> **Case Law:** *Abdul Kadir v. Salima (1886):* Marriage is a civil contract; wife’s right to claim prompt dower takes precedence over husband’s right to restitution of conjugal rights.

## Chapter III: Types of Muslim Marriages 

| Type | Classification | Definition | Legal Status & Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sahih** | Valid | Fulfills all essentials (Proposal, Acceptance, Witnesses, Capacity). | Lawful. Cohabitation allowed. Children are legitimate. Mutual inheritance rights established. Wife entitled to Mehr and Maintenance. |
| **Batil** | Void | Violates absolute prohibitions (e.g., marrying within prohibited degrees, polyandry). | Unlawful ab initio. No legal effect. No mutual rights. Children are illegitimate. |
| **Fasid** | Irregular | Violates a relative/temporary prohibition (e.g., marriage without witnesses, marrying a 5th wife, marriage during Iddat). | Can be regularized (e.g., by adding witnesses). If consummated, children are legitimate and wife gets Mehr. If unconsummated, no effect. |

### Prohibited Relationships (Hurmat)
1.  **Consanguinity (Blood):** Mother, grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, sister, aunt, niece.
2.  **Affinity (Marriage):** Mother-in-law, step-daughter, son's wife.
3.  **Fosterage (Milk):** Foster-mother and foster-sister.
4.  **Unlawful Conjunction:** Marrying two sisters simultaneously or a woman and her aunt.

## Chapter IV: Mehr and Rights of Wife

### Mehr (Dower)
A sum of money or property which the wife is entitled to receive from the husband in consideration of the marriage. It is a mark of respect, not a bride price.

**Classification:**
1.  **Specified Mehr (Mehr-i-Musamma):** Fixed at the time of marriage.
    * **Prompt (Mu’ajjal):** Payable immediately upon demand. Wife can refuse cohabitation until paid.
    * **Deferred (Mu’wajjal):** Payable on dissolution of marriage (death or divorce).
2.  **Proper Mehr (Mehr-i-Misl):** If not fixed, determined by the status of the wife's family (father's side).

### Polygamy
A Muslim man is permitted to have up to **four wives** at the same time, subject to the Quranic injunction of treating them with *absolute equality*.
* If he marries a fifth wife, the marriage is **Irregular (Fasid)**, not Void.
* **Restriction:** A Muslim woman cannot have more than one husband (Polyandry is **Void/Batil**).

## Chapter V: Dissolution of Marriage 

### A. By Husband — Talaq
1.  **Talaq-e-Ahsan (Most Approved):** Single pronouncement during a period of purity (Tuhr) followed by abstinence from sexual intercourse during the Iddat period. Revocable during Iddat.
2.  **Talaq-e-Hasan (Approved):** Three pronouncements made during three successive Tuhrs (periods of purity). Becomes irrevocable on the third pronouncement.
3.  **Talaq-e-Biddat (Triple Talaq):** Three pronouncements in a single breath or written/SMS. **ILLEGAL & VOID** in India since 2017/2019.

### B. By Wife — Judicial Divorce (Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939)
Under **Section 2** of the Act, a woman married under Muslim law serves a decree of divorce on the following grounds:
1.  **Missing Husband:** Whereabouts unknown for **4 years**.
2.  **Failure to Maintain:** Husband has neglected or failed to provide maintenance for **2 years**.
3.  **Imprisonment:** Husband sentenced to imprisonment for **7 years** or more.
4.  **Failure of Marital Obligations:** Failure to perform marital obligations for **3 years**.
5.  **Impotency:** Husband was impotent at the time of marriage and continues to be so.
6.  **Insanity/Disease:** Husband has been insane for **2 years** or suffers from leprosy/venereal disease.
7.  **Repudiation of Marriage (Option of Puberty):** If married before age 15 by a guardian, she can repudiate the marriage before turning 18 (provided not consummated).
8.  **Cruelty:** Habitual assault, associating with women of ill-repute, forcing immoral life, obstructing religious practice, or unequal treatment of wives.

### C. By Mutual Consent
1.  **Khula:** Divorce at the instance of the wife, where she agrees to give consideration (usually return of Mehr) to the husband for her release.
2.  **Mubarat:** Divorce by mutual aversion. Both desire separation. No consideration is usually exchanged, but Mehr claims may be waived.

## Chapter VI: Triple Talaq Law (2019)

### The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019
Enacted following the Supreme Court judgment in *Shayara Bano*.

* **Section 3:** Any pronouncement of Talaq-e-Biddat (instant triple talaq) by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form, is **void and illegal**.
* **Section 4:** Punishment for the husband: Imprisonment up to **3 years** and fine.
* **Section 5:** Wife is entitled to **subsistence allowance** for herself and dependent children.
* **Section 6:** Wife is entitled to **custody** of minor children.
* **Cognizability:** The offence is cognizable only if information is given by the wife or her blood relative. It is compoundable (can be settled) at the instance of the wife with the permission of the Magistrate.

> **Case Law:** *Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017):* The Supreme Court by a 3:2 majority set aside the practice of Triple Talaq, declaring it violative of Article 14 (Equality) and not protected by Article 25 (Religion).

## Chapter VII: Iddat and Maintenance

### Iddat (Waiting Period)
The period a woman must wait after the dissolution of marriage before marrying again, to ascertain pregnancy and avoid confusion of parentage.

| Situation | Iddat Period |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Divorce (Menstruating)** | Three menstrual courses (approx. 3 months). |
| **Divorce (Non-menstruating)** | Three lunar months. |
| **Death of Husband** | 4 months and 10 days (regardless of menstruation). |
| **Pregnancy** | Until delivery of the child (whichever period is longer in case of death). |
| **Unconsummated Marriage** | No Iddat required in case of divorce. |

### Maintenance (Nafqah)
1.  **During Marriage:** Husband is bound to maintain the wife (food, clothing, lodging) regardless of her own financial status, provided she is faithful and obedient.
2.  **During Iddat:** Wife is entitled to full maintenance.
3.  **Post-Iddat:**
    * **Classical View:** Maintenance ceases after Iddat.
    * **Statutory View (The 1986 Act):** The husband must make a "reasonable and fair provision" **within** the Iddat period that extends for her entire life (or until remarriage).

> **Case Law:** *Danial Latifi v. Union of India (2001):* The Supreme Court interpreted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986. It held that the husband's liability isn't limited to the Iddat period; he must make a lump sum "fair provision" *during* the Iddat period to sustain her for the future.

> **Case Law:** *Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum (1985):* Upheld the Muslim wife's right to claim maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC (secular law) if she is destitute. (Though this led to the 1986 Act, the *Danial Latifi* judgment later restored the substance of this right).

## Chapter VIII: Legitimacy and Guardianship (Hizanat)

* **Legitimacy:** A child born within 6 months of marriage is presumed illegitimate unless the father acknowledges it. A child born after 6 months is legitimate.
* **Guardianship (Hizanat):**
    * **Mother:** Has the right to custody of a male child until age 7 and a female child until puberty.
    * **Father:** Is the natural guardian and responsible for maintenance even when the child is in the mother's custody.
    * **Disqualification:** A mother may lose custody if she remarries a stranger (someone not related to the child within prohibited degrees) or leads an immoral life.
