## Chapter I: Preliminary

### Section 1. Short title and extent
(1) This Act may be called the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
(2) It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and applies also to Hindus domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who are outside the said territories.

* (b) to any person who is a Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion, and
* (c) to any person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion, unless it is proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed.

**Explanation:** The following persons are Hindus, Buddhist, Jainas or Sikhs by religion, as the case may be:
* (a) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion;

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of article 366 of the Constitution unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs.

(3) The expression "Hindu" in any portion of this Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, though not a Hindu by religion, is nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section.

> **Case Law:** Where one was initially a Hindu upon conversion to Islam, files a suit claiming dissolution of marriage on the ground of his ceasing to be a Hindu, it was held that the suit could not be maintained. — *Zulfiquer Ali v. Anuradha 1985 (2) An. LT 86.*

### Section 3. Definitions
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,—

**(a) "custom" and "usage"** signify any rule which, having been continuously and uniformly observed for a long time, has obtained the force of law among Hindus in any local area, tribe, community, group or family;
* PROVIDED that the rule is certain and not unreasonable or opposed to public policy;
* PROVIDED FURTHER that in the case of rule applicable only to a family it has not been discontinued by the family;

**(b) "district court"** means, in any area which there is a city civil court, that court, and in any other area the principal civil court of original jurisdiction and includes any other civil court which may be specified by the State Government...

**(c) "full blood" and "half blood"** — two persons are said to be related to each other by full blood when they were descended from a common ancestor by the same wife and by half blood when they are descended from a common ancestor but by different wives;

**(d) "uterine blood"** — two persons are said to be related to each other by uterine blood when they are descended from a common ancestor but by different husbands.
* *Explanation:* In clauses (c) and (d) "ancestor" includes the father and "ancestress" the mother;

**(e) "prescribed"** means prescribed by rules made under this Act;

**(f) "sapinda relationship"** with reference to any person extends as far as the third generation (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the mother, and the fifth (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father, the line being traced upwards in each case from the person concerned, who is to be counted as the first generation.
* (ii) two persons are said to be "sapindas" of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them;

**(g) "degrees of prohibited relationship"** — two persons are said to be within the "degrees of prohibited relationship" —
* (i) if one is lineal ascendant of the other; or
* (ii) if one was the wife or husband of a lineal ascendant or descendant of the other; or
* (iii) if one was the wife of the brother or of the father's or mother's brother or of the grandfather's or grandmother's brother of the other; or
* (iv) if the two are brother and sister, uncle and niece, aunt and nephew or children of brother and sister or of two brothers or of two sisters;

**Explanation:** For the purposes of clauses (f) and (g), relationship includes:
* (i) relationship by half or uterine blood as well as by full blood;
* (ii) illegitimate blood relationship as well as legitimate;
* (iii) relationship by adoption as well as by blood;

> **Case Law:** The question whether the two are sapindas of each other is to be decided on the basis of the definition as laid down under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Text would be of no help in this regard. — *Sudarsan Narkar v. Amina Mandal 1982 HLR 277.*

### Section 4. Overriding effect of Act
Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act:
* (a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in this Act;
* (b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect insofar as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act.

## Chapter II: Hindu Marriages

A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:
* (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage;
* (ii) at the time of marriage, neither party—
    * (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or
    * (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or
    * (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity;
* (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of marriage;
* (iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;
* (v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two.

> **Case Law (Bigamy):** What is to be established is that the second marriage is valid but for this provision and the spouse to the first marriage is the legally wedded spouse and the that marriage is having its existence on the date second marriage is solemnized. — *Gopal Lal v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1979 SC 713*

> **Case Law (Mental Disorder):** Whether the disease is curable or not does not make any difference. Where in due course the disease is cured, it would not affect the question of validity of marriage. — *Tulsi Bai v. Manoharan 1990 (1)HLR 318*

### Section 7. Ceremonies for a Hindu marriage
(1) A Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.

(2)-(4) [Procedural rules regarding compulsion, fines, and inspection].
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the validity of any Hindu marriage shall in no way be affected by the omission to make the entry.

> **Case Law:** The mere fact that marriage has been registered would not convert an invalid marriage into valid one. — *Krishan Paul v. Ashok Kumar Paul 1982 HLR 478*

## Chapter III: Restitution of Conjugal Rights and Judicial Separation

### Section 9. Restitution of conjugal rights
When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights...
**Explanation:** Where a question arises whether there has been reasonable excuse for withdrawal from the society, the burden of proving reasonable excuse shall be on the person who has withdrawn from the society.

> **Case Law:** Leaving home by the husband intending thereby terminating cohabitation permanently that conduct would amount to desertion. — *G. Ramakrishna Pillai v. J. Vijaya Kumari Amma AIR 1990 Ker 55.*

### Section 10. Judicial separation
(1) Either party to a marriage... may present a petition praying for a decree for judicial separation on any of grounds specified in sub-section (1) of section 13...

* (d) that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no petition annulling a marriage...
